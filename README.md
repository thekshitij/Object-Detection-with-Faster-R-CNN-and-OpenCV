# Object-Detection-with-Faster-R-CNN-and-OpenCV
This module uses a pre-trained Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50 FPN) for object detection on images. It processes the image, filters high-confidence predictions (score > 0.8), and visualizes the results using OpenCV by drawing bounding boxes and labels based on COCO dataset classes.

#Features:
Pre-trained Faster R-CNN from torchvision
Object detection and filtering by confidence
Bounding box and label visualization using OpenCV
#Requirements:
PyTorch, torchvision, OpenCV, PIL, NumPy
